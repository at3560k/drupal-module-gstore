; NOTE:  This module based fairly heavily upon Jon Peck's drupal 7 training module
;  available at lynda.com http://www.lynda.com/Drupal-tutorials/Drupal-7-Module-Development/110715-2.html
;
; and additionally upon the gmap3 utilities referenced in said module.  The
; loader is a fairly direct port of the gmap3_tools into leaflet
;   https://drupal.org/project/gmap3_tools
; 
; The leaflet folder is also under separate copyright
;
; As such, this module is released under LGPL v 2.1
